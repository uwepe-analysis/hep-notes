## Integral Volume Element in Different Dimensions

### 2-Dimensional (2D)
In 2D polar coordinates:
$d\Omega' = r \, dr \, d\theta$
- $\theta$: Ranges from $0$ to $2\pi$.

---

### 3-Dimensional (3D)
In 3D spherical coordinates: $d\Omega' = r^2 \sin\theta \, dr \, d\theta \, d\phi$  
- $\theta$: Polar angle, ranges from $0$ to $\pi$.
- $\phi$: Azimuthal angle, ranges from $0$ to $2\pi$.
